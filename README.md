Link for the POSTMAN: https://app.getpostman.com/join-team?invite_code=76cf035d0cc611b07ac38d5b8afbe3b6&target_code=af6659d62de74530555bdb72ce18ce82

If the link doesn't work, I included a import file of the postman collection it's in the root folder named "API technical exam.postman_collection.json"

Run php aritsan serve

Open xampp and start apache and mysql server

Create a new database and name it with api

Run php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
